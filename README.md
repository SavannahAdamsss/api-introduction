# API Introduction Part 1

## Objectives

- Explain what an API is
- Use fetch to GET data from an external API
- Append data from a fetch request to the DOM

- Stretch: Identify API's you would like to use!

## Notes

- API: Application Programming Interface
  * A way you can interact with or request data
  * A way that developers can share their code
    - Ex. (Wayze, Google Maps)
  * Software to software interface vs. a user interface
  * Makes more complex functionality easier to integrate
    - Hides some complexity (abstraction)
  * Sending/receiving data to/from different places & perhaps applications
    - Ex. buying something with a credit card
- Internal APIs
  - Fetch
  - DOM/Document
- External
  - Places where data is held that we can request
